Haley Gentry is graduating from the University of Utah with a Bachelor of Science in Software Development. While pursuing this degree, she had the opportunity to gain technical skills in areas such as mobile and web development, databases, networking, and design. In addition to classes, she completed an internship with CHG Healthcare, where she developed and enhanced backend Java Spring applications using both REST APIs and Apache Kafka. She enjoyed her capstone experience as this project allowed her to gain skills in custom VS Code extension development, TypeScript, and team collaboration. This capstone experience focused on engineering a complete system, handling all stages from initial concept/design to final implementation. In addition to this degree, she also has a BFA in Ballet Performance from the University of Utah and a minor in Nutrition, and she has an ongoing interest and passion for the arts.

Ali Hassoun is a soon-to-be holder of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Utah. During his time at the university, he acquired Software Engineering experience by completing an internship at Wavetronix where he gained real-life experience in problem-solving and working on new and existing projects using .NET, C#, and MySQL. In addition to that Ali particularly enjoyed working on his Capstone project which involved using Python and Typescript which were completely new to him at the time. This project helped sharpen his problem-solving and adaptability skills. In addition to this degree, Ali also has a minor in Business and has a passion to use that knowledge when tackling future problems.

# Luke Vincent

I am a programmer and designer graduating from the Kahlert School of Computing at the University of Utah. My past work includes a set of several games for the Nintendo 3ds and PC, and I also have past experience working on practical virtual reality simulations at IHMC in Pensacola Florida. Some of my other interests include music production, operating systems, and entomology. Part of what I found most interesting about this capstone project was increasing the breadth of different users able to contribute their ideas to both open and closed-source software, especially those with limited ability to utilize their hands or arms.

Michael Kamerath is graduating from the University of Utah with a degree in Data Science and a minor in Linguistics. He has worked on several computational linguistics research projects including an analysis of attachment preferences of Italian and multilingual LLMs. Additionally, he is also working on another linguistics research project dealing with modeling the acquisition of phonological processes. His interests include music, playing games with friends and family, and any sort of outdoor activity. The most interesting part of this capstone project for him was integrating speech-to-text ML models into the project.
